# Transformer Auto-Calculation Suite (for Mahati Industries)

> **Note:** This is a custom-built web application **specially made for Mahati Industries** to support its engineering and design teams.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a comprehensive suite of web-based calculators that consolidate numerous complex transformer design and analysis calculations into a single, easy-to-use interface. It is designed to automate, standardize, and accelerate the technical design process specifically for Mahati Industries.

### How to Run This Project
To access all the calculation tools, simply open the **`Main page.html`** file in your web browser. This Main Page acts as the central hub and provides links to all the individual calculation modules.
